        This research aims to enhance our understanding of the religious
        diversity and motivations of travelers along the Great American Rail
        Trail. Through in-depth interviews, surveys, content analysis, and
        participant observation, the study seeks to explore how religious
        beliefs and practices shape travel motivations and experiences, as well
        as the role of religion in shaping the trail's cultural landscape. The
        findings of this research can inform policies and strategies to better
        serve the needs of travelers along the trail and contribute to a more
        inclusive and diverse travel environment. There are minimal risks
        associated with participation, and the study's benefits lie in its
        ability to contribute to the broader body of knowledge in this field.
        Participants must be 18 years or older, fluent in English, and have
        traveled on the Great American Rail Trail within the past 12 months to
        be eligible.
