      Hey there, friends!
      <br />
      My name's Jared Thomas, and I'm excited to have you on my website. Let me
      give you a quick rundown of what's happening.
      <br />
      Starting May 14th, I'll be hopping on my bike and embarking on a 3700-mile
      journey. Crazy, right? It might take longer than 10 weeks, but I'm hyped
      to meet new people and make some friends along the way.
      <br />
      And here's the really cool part - my journey is being sponsored by Warrior
      Expeditions. They're a program that helps combat veterans suffering from
      PTSD. So not only am I getting to take this epic trip, but it's for a
      great cause too.
      <br />
      But wait, there's more! As I travel along the GRT, I'll also be conducting
      my own research. I want to learn about the motives and experiences of
      travelers on the trail when it comes to religion and spirituality. So if
      you're a traveler too, and you want to be a part of my study, sign up and
      fill out the questionnaire.
      <br />
      Be sure to follow me on social media to keep up with my journey. And while
      you're at it, shoot me a friend request! I promise I'm friendly. Oh, and
      don't forget to check out my blog for some more in-depth stories about my
      travels and research. Thanks for checking out my website, and I hope to
      hear from you soon!
